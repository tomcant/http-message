# HTTP Message

This is a simple HTTP message implementation that will eventually conform with [PSR-7](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-7/) and [PSR-17](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-17/).

Still a work in progress, this currently only implements the `Stream`, `UploadedFile` and corresponding PSR-17 factory classes.
